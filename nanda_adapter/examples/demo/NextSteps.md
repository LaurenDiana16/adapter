# Steps to create a certifier agent

1. Choose a framework (e.g. langchain): DONE
2. Define the LLM: DONE
3. Create and define tools
    1. Identify the specific data and functionalities required for the certification: TO DO
    2. Implement these as functions and provide a clear doctoring for each to explain its purpose: TO DO
4. Implement the agent core:
    1. Use the frameworkâ€™s functions to build the agent, combining the LLM, tools and prompt to guide its behavior: TO DO
5. Integrate memory: Add a memory component to allow the agent to store and recall conversation history: TO DO
6. Orchestrate the process: Have a planning agent hand off specialized agents for specific certification tasks: DONE
7. Test and refine: Test the agent with various certification scenarios to identify weaknesses, adjust prompts, and improve tool usage until it consistently provides accurate and reliable certifications: TO DO
